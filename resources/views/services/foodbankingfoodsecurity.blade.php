                                            When it comes to establishing sustainable food systems, the UN laid a
                                            firm foundation with its Sustainable Development Goal, “End hunger,
                                            achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable
                                            agriculture.” Efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition, and improve
                                            supply chain infrastructure and efficiency, have delivered some
                                            encouraging results.
                                            But much more is needed to create sustainable food systems for all.

                                            will require agricultural, technological, and economic innovation, along

                                            “bottom billion”—the very
                                            poorest, who cannot afford to pay prices equal to or above companies’
                                            production costs.

                                            in African agriculture has catalyzed a food crisis on the continent. Yet

                                            biggest source of jobs and a crucial contributor to human welfare.
                                            Thankfully, the problem has
                                            begun attracting attention and investment, fostering a new focus on

                                            Cross-Consumer Subsidies. Consumers with higher incomes provide a
