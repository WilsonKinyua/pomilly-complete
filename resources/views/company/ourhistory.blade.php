                            Pomilly East African Limited was set up by Milkah Mwai and Pondi Collins, a pair of
                            friends running a food
                            distribution business, After observing the food industry for more than a decade, they
                            realized the need for a
                            food bank in Kenya.

                            Founded in March 2018 The PEAL (Pomilly East African Limited)visited more than 30
                            charity organisations and homes
                            to gain better insight into the situation on the ground. We also took the time to
                            understand the operating models
                            of each organisation that provides free meals and dry rations to the needy and less
                            fortunate families and individuals.
